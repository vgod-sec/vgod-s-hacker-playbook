#  VGOD's Ultimate Bug Bounty Methodology

Welcome to **VGOD’s Bug Bounty Methodology** — a fully practical, real-world step-by-step guide I created to help bug bounty hunters (including myself) find **valid vulnerabilities** from recon to report.

After completing **100+ CTFs** and solving **all Web Security Academy labs**, I realized what most people lack isn’t tools — it’s **structure and focus**. This methodology is my personal playbook, now shared to help others.

##  What's Inside?

- ✅ Subdomain and URL Recon (gau, httpx, waybackurls, amass)
- ✅ JavaScript Analysis (SecretFinder, LinkFinder)
- ✅ Parameter extraction (gf, qsreplace)
- ✅ Vulnerability testing:
  - XSS (Dalfox, manual payloads)
  - IDOR / Access Control
  - SSRF, LFI/RFI
  - Open Redirect
  - CORS misconfig
  - Clickjacking
  - API Abuse
  - Business Logic flaws
- ✅ Manual Testing in Burp Suite (Autorize, Logger++, Turbo Intruder)
- ✅ Reporting Format & Tips
- ✅ Pro Tips from Top Hunters
- ✅ Growth, Practice & Mindset Advice



##  Who is This For?

Whether you're:
- A **beginner transitioning** from labs and CTFs to real-world hacking
- A **solo hunter** who needs a repeatable structure
- Someone who wants to improve their **signal-to-noise ratio**

...this methodology will help you **focus and deliver real bugs**, not just run tools.
